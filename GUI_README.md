# GUI for M2R-Julia-Sets
The interactive gui plots the Mandelbrot set for the function $z^3 - az + b$, the plot shows the Mandelbrot set wrt $b$, and you can vary $a$ by clicking new points on the plot itself.

To launch GUI, use the command `python -m julia`.

## Controls
* **Zooming** - To zoom in on an area of a plot, click and drag the area you'd like to zoom in on.
* **Choosing $a$** - To choose a new value for $a$, click any point on the plot and this complex number will be the new value.
* **Reset** - Press the r key to reset the graph to its original zoom.
* **Quit** - Press the q key to quit the application.
